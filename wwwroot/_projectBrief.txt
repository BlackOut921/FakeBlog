A good first project is to write a blog, assuming you are a new developer the below project should be easy enough to get you going.

Create a new project, mvc and identity for logins and use razor to write the UI.

Basic spec:
    - Your site must have a home page that lists all the blog posts.
    - Your site must have a page to allow a logged in user to create a blog post.
    - Your site must have a page to allow a blog posts author to edit a blog post.
    - Only a blog posts author should be able to edit a blog post.
    - Only the author should be able to see the edit link.
    - If anyone other the author attempts to access a posts edit page they must be redirected to a 403 page.
    - A blog post has these properties.
        + Id (int)
        + Author (user id, guid)
        + Title (string)
        + Content (string)
        + Created_date (datetimeoffset)
        + Last_updated date (nullable datetimeoffset)

When a user submits a blog post, the content must be validated and errors reported back to the user.

A logged in user should be able to create a new blog post.

An anonymous user should only be able to read blog post.

That's it, its a very simple exercise as it covers tiny amounts of:
    - UI Logic
    - Data validation
    - DB persistence
    - Basic MVC routing
